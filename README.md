Super-resolution (SR) is the recovery of a high resolution (HR) image or video from its low resolution (LR) counterpart. The Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network (ESPCN) model is a machine learning Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) model that takes a LR image input, extracts LR feature maps through a series of convolutional layers, then uses a sub-pixel convolution layer to convert the LR feature maps into a HR image output. 

This project is based on [Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05158.pdf).
