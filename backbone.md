# Image Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network (ESPCN)
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05158.pdf)
## Input
The model is trained using low resolution (LR) images from the DIV2K dataset that were downscaled using bicubic degredation. datagenerator.py contains the DataGenerator class, which generates batches of LR and high-resolution (HR) image pairs for training and testing.
